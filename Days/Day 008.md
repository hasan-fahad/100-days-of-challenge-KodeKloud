# Day 008 **Install Ansible on Jump Host**

During the weekly meeting, the Nautilus DevOps team discussed automation and configuration management solutions. After evaluating several options, the team decided to use **Ansible** because of its simple setup and minimal pre‑requisites. They will begin testing by using the **Jump Host** as the Ansible controller to run tasks on other servers.

---

## **Task Requirement**

Install **Ansible version 4.7.0** on the **Jump Host** using **pip3 only**. Ensure that the Ansible binary is available **system‑wide**, so that **all users** can run Ansible commands.

---

## **Steps to Install Ansible**

Run the following command on the Jump Host:

```
sudo pip3 install ansible==4.8.0
```

This installs Ansible globally using pip3 so all system users can access the `ansible` command.

## **Good to Know**

### **Ansible Fundamentals**

* **Agentless**: No agents required on managed nodes
* **SSH‑based**: Secure, uses existing SSH connectivity
* **YAML Format**: Playbooks are easy to read and maintain
* **Idempotent**: Running tasks repeatedly gives consistent results

### **Ansible Components**

* **Control Node**: The jump host running Ansible
* **Managed Nodes**: Remote servers to configure
* **Inventory**: File containing server lists/groups
* **Playbooks**: YAML files defining automation tasks
* **Modules**: Units of work (e.g., `copy`, `yum`, `service`)

### **Installation Methods**

* **pip**: `pip install ansible` (Python package manager)
* **Package Managers**: `yum install ansible`, `apt install ansible`
* **Source Install**: From GitHub repo
* **Virtual Environments**: Isolated Python environments

### **Version Considerations**

* Different versions support different collections/features
* Requires **Python 3.6+**
* Newer Ansible uses the **Collections** model
* May require additional Python libraries depending on modules
